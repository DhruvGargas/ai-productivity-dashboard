## How It Works

1. **Tasks** are stored in React state and synced to `localStorage` on every change.
2. **Focus time** is estimated at 30 minutes per completed task.
3. **Productivity score** is calculated from completion rate and completed task count.
4. **Theme preference** is saved in `localStorage` and applied on page load.


## Roadmap

- [ ] AI-powered task suggestions and prioritization
- [ ] Backend sync (database / cloud storage)
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Pomodoro timer integration
- [ ] Weekly & monthly analytics reports
